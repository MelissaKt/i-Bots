# i-bots

We, the i-bots from the Roberta RegioZentrum, are teams of students between the ages of 8 and 19. Our work involves designing and programming various robot systems in the robot factory at Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover. Every year we successfully take part in various international robot competitions. Currently we are concentrating on the RoboCup Junior competition.

# i-bots
We the i-bots are student teams between the ages of 8 and 19 from the Roberta RegioZentrum. We work on designing and programming various robot systems. We work in the Roboterfabrik at Leibniz University Hannover. Every year we successfully take part in various international robot competitions. Currently we are concentrating on the RoboCup Junior competition. We also organize our own robot competition every year, the Roberta Challenge. We have also been presenting ourselves at the IdeasExpo since 2013.
